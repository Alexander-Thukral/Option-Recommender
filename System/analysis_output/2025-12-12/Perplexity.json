    "This recommendation becomes INVALID if: (1) NIFTY gaps up > 200 points and sustains above 26,100 in first hour, (2) VIX spikes above 15, (3) Major global news event (geopolitical, Fed emergency meeting, etc.), (4) RBI announces surprise policy change.",
    "3 DTE creates elevated gamma risk - market can move faster than historical volatility suggests. Position sizing at 1 lot acknowledges this risk.",
    "Iron condors have 'negative gamma' - the closer you get to expiry and the closer NIFTY gets to your short strikes, the faster losses accelerate. This is WHY we exit by 2:00 PM on expiry day.",
    "Backtested performance is NOT indicative of future results. This specific trade setup has ~62% probability of profit but that means 38% probability of loss. Expect losses - manage them with discipline.",
    "Tax implications: Premium received is credited to your account but P&L settles at exit/expiry. Short-term capital gains taxed at slab rate for F&O. STT on sell side = 0.0625% of premium. Consult tax advisor.",
